"Standing a head taller than any other, Darius commanded respect with a mere glance. His beard, a tangled mess of silver and black, framed a face etched with the harshness of a life spent battling the elements. A single, sapphire eye glinted with an intensity that spoke of countless victories and the wisdom of a seasoned leader."
